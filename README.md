# Lab-1: PACS & Visualization
PACS (Picture archiving and communication system) is a medical imaging technology used in
healthcare organizations to securely store and digitally transmit electronic images and clinically-relevant
reports
Through this lab our aim to get introduced with the PACS servers and accomplished the following goals
shown below using two publicly available free software called Orthanc (Free PACS Server) and Ginkgo
CADx (data viewer)

# Lab 2: Software Tools
Segmentation is one of the prior steps for most of the Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system and
success of further analysis to some extend also depends on proper segmentation. In last decades
numbers of literature has come out regarding manual, semi-automatic and automatic segmentation. Still
for gold standard segmentation and testing the results of semi-automatic and automatic segmentation
manual segmentation using some tools plays an important role. In this lab we get introduced with two
publicly available tools called “ITK-SNAP” and “3D-Slicer” and performed segmentation task. The
objectives of this lab shown below.
